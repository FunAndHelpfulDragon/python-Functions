# Contribution

You want to add a function of your own? GO ahead, explain.

## Information

There are many ways in which you can contribute a function (and if you do, you will be credited). Below explains everything about how to contribute a function.

Ways to contribute:

- Via Issue
- Via Pull Request

NOTE: I AM STILL WORKING ON THIS FILE, YOU CAN STILL CONTRIBUTE THOUGH.

<!-- 
### Via Issue

This way of contributing, means that you don't have to write the code, but someone else will come and write it for you (if it gets accepted). Normally you won't always get what you wanted via this way due to not writing it yourself.

### Via Pull Request

This way of contributing will give you a higher chance of your function being implemeneted. As you have already wrote your function, we will just check the function before merging it into source. -->

### Requirments

To even start to suggest a function, there are some bare minimum requirements that need to be meet. If these are not meet you will be declined.
NOTE: This mainly applies to pull requests, but some also apply to issues

- [ ] Name (Name of your function, that is not already in use) (**both**)
- [ ] Version (Version of the function, A new version requires a new feature for example) (**Pull Request**)
- [ ] ReadMe.md (The readme file explaining what your function does) (**Pull Request**)
- [ ] File.py (The actually file) (**Pull Request**)
- [ ] test_File.py (**OPTIONAL** The test file (use pytest).) (**Pull Request**)

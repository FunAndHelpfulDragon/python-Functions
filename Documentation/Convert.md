# Convert.py

FILE: [Convert.py](../Program/Convert.py)

Converts cooridnates to the represented position

## Usage

```py
import Functions
position = Functions.LC("A3").Convert()  # returns [0, 3]
```

This is the bare minimum required (and the max in a way). Instead of `"A3"` replace it with the location of your choice.
This program also works with longer letter names such as `ABCD583`.

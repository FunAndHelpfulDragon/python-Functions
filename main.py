"""
HELLO. This is a module, or class used for multiple things.

This file should not be commited or updated with the rest, as it is more like a template.

There are 2 main uses of this file:
- Testing other modules (How they actually would be used)
- Importing from other modules (Testing to see if a module is broken, not just this file.)
